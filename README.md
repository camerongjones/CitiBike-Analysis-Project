# CitiBike Ridership Analysis  

**SQL + Python analysis of ~1M CitiBike trips to find commuter and leisure patterns.**  

## Overview  
This project analyzes NYC CitiBike data to explore ridership trends by time, station, and rider type. The goal was to understand how CitiBike is used for both commuting and leisure.  

## Key Findings  
- Weekday rush-hour peaks confirm heavy commuter use.  
- Weekend ridership reflects strong tourist and leisure demand.  
- Members take shorter, frequent trips, while casual riders take longer sightseeing rides.  

## Files in Repo  
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter Notebook with SQL + Python analysis  
- `queries/` → SQL queries (PDF)  
- `data/` → Exported CSVs  
- `presentation/` → Summary slides  

## Tools  
- SQL (SQLite)  
- Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)   

## How to Reproduce
1. Download raw data from [Lyft CitiBike System Data](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data).  
2. Run the SQL queries (see `CitiBike_SQL.pdf`) to aggregate trips.  
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells to generate plots.
